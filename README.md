# Ezi
It's pronounced Eh - zee. Uses sentiment analysis of employee reviews to double the accuracy of current job search algorithms.

Did you know that 57 percent of star ratings are fraudulent? Or that most companies that use recommendation algorithms happen to rely on star
ratings to provide high quality recommendations?
We took on this problem with a simple goal in mind: To improve the accuracy of the search and other ML algorithms.
This app tackles this problem by using a different method of search, specifically job search.
Instead of using star ratings of companies (let's be honest, who actually knows how to put their thoughts of a company in a number between 1 and 5),
we analyze the sentiment of textual reviews and process the scores to double the accuracy of some of today's best job search algorithms.
This eliminates the incredible margin of error that comes with rating by a number scale.
Other uses include the fact that by analyzing genuine employee reviews from GlassDoor, instead of using what the companies think of themselves,
our search is more genuine and truthful than any other algorithm out there.
